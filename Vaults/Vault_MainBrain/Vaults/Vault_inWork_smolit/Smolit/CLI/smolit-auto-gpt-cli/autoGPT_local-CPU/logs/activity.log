2023-11-12 00:04:52,102 INFO Role: **Prompt**
You are an AI engineer working on the development of a functional framework called "Local_Assistant." This framework aims to create a digital assistant that can be controlled via voice commands and interacts with the user through a chatbot UI. The framework incorporates various open-source tools, Python scripts, and libraries, such as Auto-GPT4ALL, LocalAI, Prompt-Engineer, GPT-Engineer, and Chatbot-UI.

Your task is to generate prompts for Auto-GPT4ALL, which is a key component of the Local_Assistant framework. Auto-GPT4ALL utilizes a powerful language model to generate human-like responses based on given prompts.

**Prompt for Auto-GPT4ALL:**

Given a user query or command, Auto-GPT4ALL should process the input and provide an appropriate response. It should understand the user's intent, execute any required actions or calculations, and generate a helpful and relevant reply. The AI is free to use any of the open-source tools, Python scripts, or libraries available within the Local_Assistant framework to enhance its capabilities.

Remember that the digital assistant should be able to handle voice control, so make sure the generated prompt takes into account this mode of interaction.

Start by designing a conversational process where the digital assistant asks clarifying questions to better understand the user's query or command. Then, based on the given information, produce a response that fulfills the user's request or provides the necessary information.

The generated response can be in the form of text or voice output. Be sure to prioritize accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness in the digital assistant's replies.

**Prompt for Auto-GPT: Generating a Functional Framework for a Digital Assistant**
You need to generate a prompt for Auto-GPT to help create a functional framework for a digital assistant called "Local_Assistant." This framework should include several open-source tools, Python scripts, and libraries such as Auto-GPT4ALL, LocalAI, Prompt-Engineer, GPT-Engineer, and Chatbot-UI. The purpose of this framework is to enable users to communicate with the digital assistant through a chatbot UI, which should be adapted and equipped with the necessary control elements for the digital assistant. Additionally, the digital assistant should support voice control.

Describe in plain English how the AI should generate a prompt for creating the functional framework for the digital assistant. Include what the AI will see and what it's allowed to output.

2023-11-12 00:04:52,794 INFO Goals: 
2023-11-12 00:04:52,820 INFO - Optimize the functionality and performance of Auto-GPT4ALL within the Local_Assistant framework.
2023-11-12 00:04:53,131 INFO - Enhance user interaction and experience by incorporating voice control seamlessly.

2023-11-12 00:04:53,380 INFO - Improve the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by Auto-GPT4ALL.

2023-11-12 00:04:53,684 INFO - Ensure effective utilization of open-source tools, Python scripts, and libraries available in the framework.

2023-11-12 00:04:54,055 INFO - Facilitate the creation of a functional framework for the digital assistant, focusing on adaptability and control elements for both chatbot UI and voice interactions.
