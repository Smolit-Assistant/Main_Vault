Kubeflow is an open-source machine learning platform designed to deploy machine learning workflows on Kubernetes. To use Kubeflow, you set up a Kubernetes cluster, install Kubeflow on the cluster, and then you can start creating and running ML workflows. It provides components for each stage of a machine learning project, such as data preprocessing, model training, serving, and end-to-end workflow controls.
