Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight containers. To use Docker, you install Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine on Linux), find or create aÂ `Dockerfile`Â which defines your application's environment, useÂ `docker build`Â to create an image, and then useÂ `docker run`Â to instantiate a container from the image. Docker Hub provides a large number of pre-built images to get started quickly with popular software.
