Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is highly customizable with extensions, has built-in Git support, and provides powerful features for software development. To use it, you download and install VSCode, open or create a workspace or folder, and start coding. You can install extensions for additional languages, debuggers, and tools through the built-in Extension Marketplace.
