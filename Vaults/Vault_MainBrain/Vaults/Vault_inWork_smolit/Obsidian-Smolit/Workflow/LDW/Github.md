GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It allows users to host and manage Git repositories, track changes, collaborate with others, and manage project progress. To use GitHub, you create an account, set up a new repository (repo), and can then start pushing code from your local machine using Git commands. GitHub also has features like issues, pull requests, and actions for improved collaboration and CI/CD workflows.

`repo2docker`Â is a tool that allows users to build, run, and push Docker images from source code repositories that host Jupyter notebooks, desktop applications, and other interactive computing environments. To useÂ `repo2docker`, you need to have Docker installed and running. With a command likeÂ `jupyter-repo2docker <repository-url>`, you can build a Docker image that starts a Jupyter notebook server with the repository's contents already available.
